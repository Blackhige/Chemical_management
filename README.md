# Chemical_management
A webpage and its database for the management of chemicals

This webpage is part of the ERASMUS PROJECT: Chemical database and UI. It was done in 2 months by students Ariel GÃ³mez, Pol Villar (me), and Edgar Montero.

On this repo, you can find the webpage and the database created for this project.
Ariel and I designed the database, and then I took the design and assembled it on Oracle, then imported it into MariaDB, our chosen database management system changing the structure to be handled in MySql, upgrading its previous design to cover more functionalities. 

Ariel handled all the webpage UI and backend, and connected it to the database to make queries and updates. We don't talk about Edgar's part (Android app on the user manual).
The project has been coded to be used on a localhost (using XAMPP), so changes should be done to the db_conn.php file if anyone wants to use a different server. The database has been cleaned and filled with dummy entries, to keep all sensitive information protected.

There is a user manual that explains how to import the database, how the webpage works, and a brief description of the Android app (it is not posted on this repo).
